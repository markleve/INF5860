    "## Image classification with deep learning and dense neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are supposed to implement a basic neural network for image classification. The network will be densly connected, with an arbitrary number of layers, and number of nodes in each layer. We shall implement a ReLu activation function, and use a softmax activation in the last layer. The error will be measured with a cross-entropy loss function, and the cost will be minimized using a stochastic gradient descent optimization routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation format\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be guided through the implementation step by step, and you can check your implementation at each step. Each subtask will be judged independently, so it should be possible to do one task even if you have not succeded in the previous. Note, however, that each step needs to be correct in order for the whole method to work at the end.\n",

    "4. Backward propagation through network with *arbitrary number of layer* where each layer has an *arbitrary number of nodes*\n",
    "  1. Derivative of the ReLu activation function\n",
    "  2. The rest of the backwar propagation\n",
    "5. Parameter update using Gradient Descent optimization\n",
    "6. Run the finished method\n",
    "  1. Reproduce result with default settings\n",
    "  2. Exceed the default result by experimenting with different hyperparameter configurations.\n",

    "### Additional notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Most variables should be self-explanatory, but there are four important dictionaries worth mentioning, as they will control the data flow of the entire program\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conf`: Contains all configurations of the program. These configurations will be passed around most functions, even though we most often will only need a couple of them; this is so that you are freer to experiment outside the boundaries of the program skeleton. They are set with some default values in the `config()` function in `src/main.py`.\n",
    "- `params`: Contains all trainiable parameters, that is, all weight and bias arrays.\n",
    "- `grads`: Contains the gradients of the respective trainable parameters.\n",
    "- `features`: Contains input and output data, in addition to linear combination arrays `Z` and activation arrays `A`.\n",
